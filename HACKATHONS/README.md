# Hackathon Projects

This directory contains all the hackathon projects I participated in during the PLP Africa Software Development course.

Each project in this section represents a team or solo challenge aimed at applying the skills learned throughout the program — including problem-solving, collaboration, and real-world software development under time constraints.
