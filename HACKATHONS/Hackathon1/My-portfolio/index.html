          <h2>My Interests</h2>
          <p>
            I am deeply intrigued by AI, Machine Learning, and Robotics, as well as the endless possibilities of technology to shape the future.
            Outside of tech, I find solace in the strategy and complexity of chess, the creative exploration of coding, and the joy of reading books.
            Though not professionally, poetry allows me to express my thoughts in a more artistic way, and on occasion, I indulge in watching movies for a bit of relaxation and inspiration.
            These interests, varied yet interconnected, fuel my curiosity and drive for innovation.
